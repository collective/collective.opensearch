===================

Produce Open Search Feeds
-------------------------

collective.opensearch adds the possibility to add OpenSearch compatible search results to your Plone site.

* site wide: this is a simple copy of the plone search so all option
  that you may pass to the standard /search will be recognized as well.
* for a collection/topic: You can search inside a topic, i.e. you
  define a 'base query' as a topic and additional parameters of the query
  are applied additional.


OpenSearch is a collection of simple formats for the sharing of search results.

OpenSearch helps search engines and search clients communicate by
introducing a common set of formats to perform search requests and
syndicate search results. OpenSearch helps search engines and search
clients communicate by introducing a common set of formats to perform
search requests and syndicate search results. The OpenSearch description
document format can be used to describe a search engine so that it can
be used by search client applications. The OpenSearch response elements
can be used to extend existing syndication formats, such as RSS and
Atom, with the extra metadata needed to return search results

collective.opensearch enables you to syndicate the search results of
your plone site by formatting them in the RSS or Atom formats, augmented
with OpenSearch response elements.

Implemented extensions and conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- opensearch
- relevance
- opensearch description for autodiscovery
- suggestions so that browsers can autocomplete
- response elements and first, previous, next, last links


Consume Open Search Feeds
-------------------------

collective.opensearch adds a view to the link type that lets you
search OpenSearch (or other searches that return RSS or Atom, pretty
much any other format feed parser supports and KML) compatible search
providers within your site. The feeds do not need to implement
the opensearch extensions it suffices that they are valid feeds (e.g you
can query yahoo, bing, google site search or any plone site). When you
add a link with an open search url this view will be automatically set.
To search e.g. plone.org from your site add a Link with the url:
``http://plone.org/search_rss?SearchableText={searchTerms}``

You can combine several open search links as a metasearch. All
OpenSearch links inside a folder will be queried and their results
displayed when you change the view of a folder to 'Open Search View'



Usage:
------

1) A single remote search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you add a link content type with a open search description
compatible url (i.e. it has a parameter {searchTerms} in the querystring)
the view of the link will be set when the link is saved.

The view consits of a simple searchform and the results of the query



2) search multiple sources at once
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build a simple metasearch create a folder and add your query links to it.
Change the view of the folder to 'Open Search View'.
The view consist of a search form (currently only for full text search)
which input will be appied to all open search links (i.e. any link that
has  'Open Search View' set as its view). The results of the
searches will be displayed in tabs beneath the form. The queries are
executed asynchronously via AJAX, so you do not have to wait until the
last query has finished.



Abusing collective.opensearch to display miscelaneous feeds
-----------------------------------------------------------

3) display an abritary 'static' feed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allthough the main focus of this product is to produce and display
search feeds you may use it to display any valid feed. If the url of the
link you added does not contain the {searchTerms} parameter and  'Open Search View'
(you have to select the view manually from the 'display' menu) is
selected as the view of the link, the feed will be fetched regardless of
the presence of a query parameter and its results will be displayed.
The search form will not be displayed in the absence of the
``{searchTerms}`` parameter.

4) display multiple feeds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add your feeds to display to a folder (as in [2]) and select  'Open Search View'
as the display view of the folder All feeds that do not have a
``{searchTerms}`` parameter in their url will be fetched immediately,
regardless if a search input was provided. The search form will only be
displayed if at least one of the links inside the folder has a
``{searchTerms}`` parameter.



5) Use collective.opensearch to search inside your collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As opensearch results are added to all collections you may use it as a
searchform to search inside your collections. if you use a relative
link (e.g. /mycollection/SearchableText={searchTerms}) you have to
choose  'Open Search View' manually to display the search results.

Known limitations issues and caveats
------------------------------------

- Currently only the {searchTerms} parameter for full text search is recognized and supported
- add '<match path="regex:^.*/opensearchresults.html*" abort="1" />' to your deliverance/xdv/diazo rules
- internal searches as described in [5] will always be executed as 'anonymous'
