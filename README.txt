Project Description
===================

collective.opensearch adds the possibility to add OpenSearch compatible
search results to your Plone site.

OpenSearch is a collection of simple formats for the sharing of search results.

OpenSearch helps search engines and search clients communicate by
introducing a common set of formats to perform search requests
and syndicate search results.
The OpenSearch description document format can be used to describe a
search engine so that it can be used by search client applications.
The OpenSearch response elements can be used to extend existing
syndication formats, such as RSS and Atom, with the extra metadata
needed to return search results.

collective.opensearch enables you to syndicate the search results of
your plone site by formatting them in the RSS or Atom formats,
augmented with OpenSearch response elements.

collective.opensearch adds a type SearchFeed that lets you search
OpenSearch (or other Searches that return RSS or Atom so any plone Site)
compatible search providers within your site.

To search e.g. plone.org from your site add a search feed with the url:
